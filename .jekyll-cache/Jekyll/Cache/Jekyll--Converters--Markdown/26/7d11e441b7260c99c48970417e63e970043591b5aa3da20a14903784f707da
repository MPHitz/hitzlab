<p>We are currently looking for a postdoc to join our group. The focus of his work will be functional validation of novel candidate genes in Mouse and/or zebrafish. Feel free to send questions or your CV directly to Marc-Phillip.hitz@uksh.de</p>

<h1 id="applications">Applications</h1>

<p>We are always looking for new group members with a strong interest in genetics, bioinformatics, cardiac development and paediatric cardiology.</p>

<p>Interested in doing a PhD or a postdoc with us?
Please send me an email briefly describing your research question of interest and an UpToDate CV.</p>

<p>Students interested in pursuing a bachelor and master degree in the field of cardiovascular genetics are always welcome. You can either contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office. Students will be supervised by an experienced Postdoc and we offer highly motivated students a job as a “studentische Hilfskraft” to support their experimental work.</p>

<p>Medical students interested in an experimental thesis are also welcome. We support students who work fulltime for a year and strongly encourage application for bursaries, such as a “Doktorandenstipendium” of the DZHK or Herzstiftung.</p>
