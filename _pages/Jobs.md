# Open positions

We are currently looking for a PhD to join our group. The focus of the work will be combining genomic and imaging data to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of cardiac pathologies and established consistent genotype-phenotype correlation. Feel free to send questions or your CV directly to Marc-Phillip.hitz@uksh.de

# Applications

We are always looking for new group members with a strong interest in genetics, bioinformatics, cardiac development and paediatric cardiology.
Are you interested in doing a PhD or a postdoc with us? Please send an email briefly describing your research question of interest and an UpToDate CV.

Students interested in pursuing a bachelor and master degree in the field of cardiovascular genetics are always welcome. You can either contact us per email or stop by my office. An experienced postdoc will supervise students, and we offer highly motivated students a job as a “studentische Hilfskraft” to support their experimental work.

Medical students interested in an experimental thesis are also welcome. We support students who work fulltime for a year and strongly encourage application for bursaries, such as a “Doktorandenstipendium” of the DZHK or Herzstiftung.

Currently, we offer the following Masterthesis projects in our group:
